### Created using React and Redux

To get started,

-> Create a Folder with the Desired Folder-Name (eg. Sahil Nigam Dashboard).
-> Inside the folder that you just created, open terminal / git bash by right-clicking inside the folder.
-> Now enter `git clone https://github.com/Sahil2315/Accuknox-Assessment` in the terminal (don't close the terminal yet).
-> Now enter `npm install` in that same folder / directory from within the terminal.
-> Now run `npm run dev` in that same terminal.
-> The React Development Server must now start and provide you with a URL that looks something like this `http://localhost:5173` in the terminal.
-> Go to that URL by either `ctrl + clicking on that link` or `copying the link into your browser`.
-> The Code should now Run.
